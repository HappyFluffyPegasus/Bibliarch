## **⚠️ Known Issues (As Documented)**

### **Critical Issues Still Present:**
1. **Navigation Looping** - Character nodes (especially in lists) create infinite loops
2. **Save System** - Changes inside character canvases may not persist properly
3. **Timeline System** - Event nodes have typing backwards issue
4. **Folder Navigation** - May show wrong content/breadcrumbs in some cases

### **Planned Features Not Yet Implemented:**
1. **Timeline System** - Storyboard-style event nodes with duration bars
2. **Relationship System** - Visual character relationship mapping
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Story structure analysis
4. **Real-time Collaboration** - Multi-user editing
