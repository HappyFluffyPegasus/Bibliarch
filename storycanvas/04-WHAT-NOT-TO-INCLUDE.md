# Bibliarch Anti-Features & Development Guardrails

## Philosophy: Focus Over Feature Creep

This document defines what NOT to build, preventing scope creep and maintaining product focus. Every "no" here enables a better "yes" to core user needs.

---

## ANTI-FEATURES: What NOT to Build

### 1. Do NOT Build a Full Writing Editor
**Why This Seems Good**: Users could write entire stories within Bibliarch
**Why We Won't**: 
- Dilutes focus from story planning to story writing
- Competes with established tools (Word, Scrivener, Google Docs)
- Creates massive scope creep and maintenance burden
- Users already have preferred writing tools

**Instead Do**: 
- Provide excellent export capabilities to writing tools
- Focus on story planning and organization
- Integrate with existing writing tools rather than replacing them

### 2. Do NOT Add Social Media Features
**Why This Seems Good**: Writers could share progress and get feedback
**Why We Won't**:
- Creates content moderation challenges
- Shifts focus from tool functionality to social engagement
- Introduces privacy and safety concerns for young users
- Requires community management resources

**Instead Do**:
- Simple project sharing with specific collaborators
- Export capabilities for sharing on existing social platforms
- Integration with existing writing communities rather than creating new ones

### 3. Do NOT Build Advanced Animation Systems
**Why This Seems Good**: Animated node transitions would look impressive
**Why We Won't**:
- Performance overhead for marginal user benefit
- Complexity increases development and maintenance time
- Accessibility issues for motion-sensitive users
- Distraction from core functionality

**Instead Do**:
- Simple, purposeful transitions that improve usability
- Focus animation budget on feedback and state changes
- Prioritize accessibility and performance over visual flair

### 4. Do NOT Create Complex Permission Systems
**Why This Seems Good**: Enterprise-level role management seems professional
**Why We Won't**:
- Adds complexity that 90% of users won't need
- Creates support burden for edge cases
- Delays shipping core functionality
- Makes simple sharing complicated

**Instead Do**:
- Simple view/edit permissions for shared projects
- Basic ownership model that's easy to understand
- Iterate based on actual user needs, not assumed enterprise requirements

### 5. Do NOT Build AI Story Generation
**Why This Seems Good**: AI could generate story ideas and characters
**Why We Won't**:
- Undermines the creative process that writers value
- Creates dependency on expensive external services
- Quality control challenges for generated content
- Shifts focus from organizing human creativity to replacing it

**Instead Do**:
- AI-powered suggestions for story structure improvements
- Smart templates based on genre analysis
- Focus AI on organization and analysis, not creation

## PERFECTIONISM TRAPS: Avoid These Development Pitfalls

### 1. Don't Perfect the Visual Design Before Testing Functionality
**Trap**: Spending weeks perfecting node aesthetics before users can test basic interactions
**Why It's Harmful**: 
- Delays user feedback on core functionality
- Risks building beautiful features nobody needs
- Design preferences are subjective; functionality problems are objective

**Better Approach**:
- Ship basic functionality with "good enough" design
- Test with real users to identify actual pain points
- Iterate on design based on usage patterns, not assumptions

### 2. Don't Build the "Perfect" Database Schema Upfront
**Trap**: Designing database schema for every possible future feature
**Why It's Harmful**:
- Over-engineering creates complexity without immediate benefit
- Future requirements are often different than predicted
- Complex schemas are harder to modify later

**Better Approach**:
- Design schema for current phase requirements
- Use migration strategy for future changes
- Optimize for change, not for perfection

### 3. Don't Wait for Perfect Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Trap**: Ensuring identical experience across all browsers before shipping
**Why It's Harmful**:
- Delays shipping to majority of users (Chrome/Safari/Firefox)
- Edge cases consume disproportionate development time
- Perfect compatibility often requires compromising best features

**Better Approach**:
- Target 90% of user base first (modern browsers)
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features
- Document known limitations and iterate based on user feedback

### 4. Don't Build Comprehensive Undo/Redo from Day One
**Trap**: Implementing complex undo system for every possible action
**Why It's Harmful**:
- Complex state management delays core features
- Most actions don't need undo (navigation, viewing)
- Auto-save reduces need for comprehensive undo

**Better Approach**:
- Implement undo for destructive actions only (delete, major edits)
- Use auto-save to minimize data loss risk
- Build comprehensive undo system based on user patterns

### 5. Don't Optimize Performance Prematurely
**Trap**: Optimizing for 1000+ node canvases before users have 10 nodes
**Why It's Harmful**:
- Premature optimization complicates code unnecessarily
- Real performance bottlenecks differ from predicted ones
- Users need basic functionality before scale

**Better Approach**:
- Build for reasonable expected usage (50-100 nodes)
- Monitor real user performance patterns
- Optimize based on actual bottlenecks, not theoretical ones

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS: What NOT to Choose

### Architecture Anti-Patterns

#### Don't Use Microservices Architecture
**Why It Seems Good**: Scalable, modern, allows team specialization
**Why We Won't**:
- Adds complexity without current benefit
- Increases deployment and monitoring overhead
- Overkill for single team with unified codebase

**Use Instead**: Modular monolith with clear service boundaries

#### Don't Build Custom Canvas Rendering Engine
**Why It Seems Good**: Complete control over rendering performance
**Why We Won't**:
- Massive development overhead for marginal benefit
- Browser canvas APIs are sufficient for current needs
- SVG/HTML solutions are more accessible and maintainable

**Use Instead**: SVG-based rendering with HTML fallbacks

#### Don't Use NoSQL Database for Primary Storage
**Why It Seems Good**: Flexible schema, JSON document storage
**Why We Won't**:
- Relational data (users, stories, nodes) fits SQL model well
- Query complexity increases without ACID guarantees
- Team expertise is stronger in SQL databases

**Use Instead**: PostgreSQL with JSON columns for flexible data

### Technology Anti-Choices

#### Don't Use Cutting-Edge Frontend Framework
**Why It Seems Good**: Latest features, performance improvements
**Why We Won't**:
- Stability issues in production
- Limited community resources and libraries
- Team learning curve delays development

**Use Instead**: Established framework with strong ecosystem (React/Vue/Svelte)

#### Don't Build Custom State Management
**Why It Seems Good**: Perfect fit for application needs
**Why We Won't**:
- Development time better spent on user features
- Existing solutions handle 99% of use cases
- Custom solutions lack community support and debugging tools

**Use Instead**: Established state management (Redux, Zustand, or React Context)

#### Don't Use Serverless for Everything
**Why It Seems Good**: Infinite scale, pay-per-use pricing
**Why We Won't**:
- Cold start delays affect user experience
- Debugging and monitoring complexity
- Vendor lock-in concerns

**Use Instead**: Traditional hosting with serverless for specific use cases

## USER EXPERIENCE ANTI-PATTERNS

### Interface Design Don'ts

#### Don't Copy Other Visual Tools Exactly
**Why It Seems Good**: Users know existing patterns from Figma, Miro
**Why We Won't**:
- Story planning has different mental models than design tools
- Generic interface doesn't serve specific story planning needs
- Differentiation comes from purpose-built features

**Do Instead**: Adapt familiar patterns for story-specific workflows

#### Don't Make Everything Customizable
**Why It Seems Good**: Users can tailor interface to preferences
**Why We Won't**:
- Analysis paralysis from too many options
- Support burden from infinite configuration combinations
- Complexity overwhelms core functionality

**Do Instead**: Carefully chosen defaults with essential customization only

#### Don't Use Generic Icons and Labels
**Why It Seems Good**: Universal symbols are widely understood
**Why We Won't**:
- Story planning has specific terminology and concepts
- Generic language doesn't guide users through story development
- Missed opportunity to educate users about story craft

**Do Instead**: Story-specific terminology with helpful explanations

### Workflow Anti-Patterns

#### Don't Force Linear Story Development
**Why It Seems Good**: Guides users through proper story structure
**Why We Won't**:
- Writers have different creative processes
- Rigid workflows frustrate experienced users
- Creative process is inherently non-linear

**Do Instead**: Flexible tools that support various creative approaches

#### Don't Make Collaboration the Default
**Why It Seems Good**: Encourages community and feedback
**Why We Won't**:
- Many writers prefer solitary creative process
- Collaboration adds complexity most users don't need
- Privacy is important for creative work in progress

**Do Instead**: Private by default with optional collaboration features

## DECISION FRAMEWORK: How to Say No

### Questions to Ask Before Adding Features

1. **Does this serve the core use case of story planning?**
   - If no, defer or reject
   - If yes, continue evaluation

2. **Do 80% of our target users need this?**
   - If no, consider it for later phases
   - If yes, evaluate implementation cost

3. **Can we build this simply without compromising existing features?**
   - If no, defer until we can do it right
   - If yes, consider for current phase

4. **Does this align with our technical architecture decisions?**
   - If no, reject or modify approach
   - If yes, evaluate user benefit vs. development cost

5. **Will this feature still be valuable in 2 years?**
   - If no, probably not worth building
   - If yes, consider long-term maintenance implications

### Red Flags That Trigger "No"

- Feature requests that begin with "Wouldn't it be cool if..."
- Requests to match features from unrelated tools
- Suggestions that require fundamental architecture changes
- Features that primarily serve edge cases or power users
- Anything that duplicates functionality of established tools users already love

### How to Communicate "No" to Users

- Acknowledge the suggestion and explain the reasoning
- Suggest alternative solutions using existing features
- Explain how the request conflicts with product focus
- Offer to revisit the suggestion in future phases if appropriate
- Thank users for engagement and continued feedback

## Success Metrics for Saying No

### Feature Request Rejection Rate
- **Target**: Reject 70-80% of feature requests
- **Why**: Indicates strong product focus and clear vision

### Development Velocity Maintenance
- **Target**: Maintain consistent sprint velocity
- **Why**: Feature creep typically slows development significantly

### User Satisfaction with Core Features
- **Target**: 90%+ satisfaction with primary use cases
- **Why**: Better to excel at core features than be mediocre at many

### Technical Debt Accumulation
- **Target**: Stable or decreasing technical debt levels
- **Why**: Scope creep often increases technical debt
