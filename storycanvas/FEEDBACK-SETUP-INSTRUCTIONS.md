## ðŸš€ Setup Steps (Do These Now!)

### Step 1: Create Database Table

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `database-feedback-setup.sql` in your project root
4. Copy the entire SQL content
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run**

**Expected Result**: You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this is correct!

---

### Step 2: Configure Admin Email

Open `src/app/admin/feedback/page.tsx` and find line 12:

```typescript
const ADMIN_EMAIL = 'your@email.com' // TODO: Change this to your email
```

**Change it to your actual email address:**

```typescript
const ADMIN_EMAIL = 'youremail@example.com'
```

This controls who can access the admin dashboard at `/admin/feedback`.

### Step 3: Test the Feedback Flow

1. **Start your dev server** (if not already running)
2. **Open a story** in NeighborNotes
3. **Look for the feedback button** - It's next to the theme toggle in the top-right
4. **Click it and submit test feedback**:
   - Try submitting as a logged-in user
   - Try different feedback types (Bug, Feature, General)
5. **Check the admin dashboard** at `/admin/feedback`
