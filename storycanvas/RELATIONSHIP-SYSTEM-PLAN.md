# **NeighborNotes Relationship System Implementation Plan**

## **Overview**
A visual relationship mapping system using a special relationship canvas node that contains character profile pictures connected with colored lines to show different types of relationships, making story planning more intuitive and visual.

---

## **What We're Building:**
A special relationship canvas node (like how image nodes contain images or text nodes contain text) that acts as a mini-canvas for relationship mapping with automatically populated character profile pictures!

---

## **How It Will Work:**

### **Step 1: The Relationship Canvas Node**
- **What**: A special node type that acts like a "canvas within a canvas"
- **Where**: Can be placed anywhere, but typically in "Characters & Relationships" folder
- **Function**: Contains an internal relationship mapping area with character profile pictures
- **Layout**: Profile pictures appear as circles inside this dedicated node space

### **Step 2: Character Selection System**
**User opens the relationship canvas node and sees:**
1. **Character Selection Interface** â†’ dropdown/list showing all character names from the story
2. **Auto-Population** â†’ when user selects a character name, their profile picture automatically appears in the node
3. **Profile Picture Sources** â†’ pictures are pulled from existing character nodes' `profileImageUrl` field
4. **Contained System** â†’ everything happens inside this special relationship node

### **Step 3: Creating Relationships**
**User clicks a "Connect" button within the relationship node, then:**
1. **Click first profile picture** â†’ circle gets a blue glow
2. **Click second profile picture** â†’ a line appears between them
3. **Relationship popup opens** asking:
   - What type of relationship? (dropdown menu)
   - How strong? (1-3 dots for weak/medium/strong)
   - Any notes? (text box for details)

### **Step 4: Relationship Types & Colors**
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Romantic (dating, married, crushes)
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Family (siblings, parents, cousins)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Friends (best friends, close friends)
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Work/Professional (boss, coworker, teammates)
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Rivals/Enemies (hate, competition, conflicts)
- âš« **Gray**: Other (neighbors, strangers, complicated)

### **Step 5: Line Styles Show Strength**
- **Thick solid line**: Strong relationship
- **Medium line**: Normal relationship
- **Thin dotted line**: Weak/distant relationship

### **Step 6: Interactive Features**
- **Hover over line**: Shows relationship label (like "siblings" or "rivals")
- **Click on line**: Opens details popup to edit or delete
- **Filter buttons**: Hide/show certain relationship types
- **Legend**: Color guide in corner of canvas

## **Technical Implementation:**

### **New Node Type Required:**
1. **Add 'relationship-canvas' node type**: Special node that contains an internal canvas area
2. **Character Selection System**: Dropdown/interface to select from all character nodes in the story
3. **Auto-Population**: System automatically pulls `profileImageUrl` from selected character nodes
4. **Internal Canvas Logic**: Handles positioning, connections, and interactions within the node
5. **Profile Picture Management**: Displays character profile pictures as circular nodes inside the relationship canvas node

### **File Changes Needed:**
1. **Update HTMLCanvas.tsx**: Add new 'relationship-canvas' node type with internal canvas rendering
2. **New component**: RelationshipCanvasNode for the internal relationship mapping interface
3. **Character Detection System**: Function to find all character nodes across the story and extract their data
4. **Update templates.ts**: Replace relationship canvas template with relationship-canvas node type
5. **Internal Connection System**: Handle relationships within the relationship canvas node (not main canvas)

### **How the Code Works:**
1. **Character Detection**: System scans all story canvases to find character nodes and their profile pictures
2. **Selection Interface**: User picks characters from a list, system auto-adds their profile pictures to internal canvas
3. **Contained Canvas**: All relationship mapping happens inside the special node, not on main canvas
4. **Data Storage**: Relationships saved within the relationship canvas node data structure
5. **Visual Rendering**: SVG lines drawn between profile pictures inside the relationship canvas node

### **User Interface:**
- **Relationship Canvas Node**: Special node type available in toolbar (like text, image, character nodes)
- **Internal Interface**: Character selection dropdown, connection tools, and legend all contained within the node
- **Profile Picture Display**: Circular character images arranged inside the relationship canvas node area

---

## **User Workflow Example:**
1. Create character nodes throughout your story (with profile pictures uploaded)
2. Add a "Relationship Canvas" node to your canvas (new node type from toolbar)
3. Double-click the relationship canvas node to open its internal interface
4. See character selection dropdown populated with all your story's character names
5. Select "Alice" from dropdown â†’ her profile picture appears as a circle in the canvas
6. Select "Bob" from dropdown â†’ his profile picture appears as a circle in the canvas
7. Click "Connect" tool within the relationship canvas node
8. Click Alice's profile picture, then Bob's profile picture
9. Select "Friends â†’ Best Friends" from relationship popup
10. Green line appears connecting their profile pictures inside the node!
11. Repeat to build your complete relationship network

**Result**: Self-contained relationship mapping node with all your character relationships visualized using their actual profile pictures!

## **Data Structures:**

### **Relationship Connection Object:**
```typescript
interface RelationshipConnection {
  id: string
  fromCharacterId: string
  toCharacterId: string
  relationshipType: 'romantic' | 'family' | 'friends' | 'professional' | 'rivals' | 'other'
  strength: 1 | 2 | 3  // weak, medium, strong
  label: string        // "married", "siblings", "best friends", etc.
  notes?: string       // additional details
  isBidirectional: boolean  // true for mutual relationships
}
```

### **Character Node Extensions:**
```typescript
interface CharacterNode extends Node {
  profileImageUrl?: string
  relationshipPosition?: { x: number, y: number }  // position on relationship map
}
```

## **Visual Design Specifications:**

### **Character Representation:**
- **Circle diameter**: 80px
- **Profile picture**: Cropped to circle, 70px diameter
- **Border**: 5px, color matches character theme
- **Hover effect**: Subtle glow and scale up 10%

### **Relationship Lines:**
- **Strong**: 4px line width
- **Medium**: 2px line width
