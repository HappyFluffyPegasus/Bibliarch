# **StoryCanvas Relationship System Implementation Plan**

## **Overview**
A visual relationship mapping system where users can connect character profile pictures with colored lines to show different types of relationships, making story planning more intuitive and visual.

---

## **What We're Building:**
A visual map where users can connect character profile pictures with colored lines to show relationships, just like drawing connections on a poster board!

---

## **How It Will Work:**

### **Step 1: The Relationship Canvas**
- **Where**: Add a new section to the "Characters & Relationships" folder
- **What**: A special canvas that automatically shows all characters with their profile pictures
- **Layout**: Characters appear as circles with their uploaded profile pictures inside

### **Step 2: Creating Relationships**
**User clicks a "Connect" button, then:**
1. **Click first character** â†’ their circle gets a blue glow
2. **Click second character** â†’ a line appears between them
3. **Relationship popup opens** asking:
   - What type of relationship? (dropdown menu)
   - How strong? (1-3 dots for weak/medium/strong)
   - Any notes? (text box for details)

### **Step 3: Relationship Types & Colors**
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Romantic (dating, married, crushes)
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Family (siblings, parents, cousins)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Friends (best friends, close friends)
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Work/Professional (boss, coworker, teammates)
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Rivals/Enemies (hate, competition, conflicts)
- âš« **Gray**: Other (neighbors, strangers, complicated)

### **Step 4: Line Styles Show Strength**
- **Thick solid line**: Strong relationship
- **Medium line**: Normal relationship
- **Thin dotted line**: Weak/distant relationship

### **Step 5: Interactive Features**
- **Hover over line**: Shows relationship label (like "siblings" or "rivals")
- **Click on line**: Opens details popup to edit or delete
- **Filter buttons**: Hide/show certain relationship types
- **Legend**: Color guide in corner of canvas

## **Technical Implementation:**

### **File Changes Needed:**
1. **Add to templates.ts**: New relationship canvas template
2. **Update HTMLCanvas.tsx**: Add relationship mode and connection drawing
3. **New component**: RelationshipModal for editing relationship details
4. **Update character template**: Add "View Relationships" button

### **How the Code Works:**
1. **Character Detection**: System finds all character nodes and their profile pictures
2. **Connection Tool**: New tool mode for drawing relationship lines
3. **Data Storage**: Relationships saved as special connection objects with extra data
4. **Visual Rendering**: Different colored SVG lines drawn between character circles

### **User Interface:**
- **Toolbar button**: "Relationships" mode (like existing text/image tools)
- **Relationship panel**: Shows legend and filter checkboxes
- **Quick add buttons**: Common relationships like "Make them siblings" or "Make them friends"

---

## **User Workflow Example:**
1. Go to Characters & Relationships folder
2. Click "View Relationship Map" button
3. See all characters laid out with their photos
4. Click "Add Relationship" tool
5. Click Mom character, then Dad character
6. Select "Family â†’ Married" from dropdown
7. Red line appears connecting them!
8. Repeat for all character relationships

**Result**: Visual family tree/relationship web that updates automatically when you add new characters!

## **Data Structures:**

### **Relationship Connection Object:**
```typescript
interface RelationshipConnection {
  id: string
  fromCharacterId: string
  toCharacterId: string
  relationshipType: 'romantic' | 'family' | 'friends' | 'professional' | 'rivals' | 'other'
  strength: 1 | 2 | 3  // weak, medium, strong
  label: string        // "married", "siblings", "best friends", etc.
  notes?: string       // additional details
  isBidirectional: boolean  // true for mutual relationships
}
```

### **Character Node Extensions:**
```typescript
interface CharacterNode extends Node {
  profileImageUrl?: string
  relationshipPosition?: { x: number, y: number }  // position on relationship map
}
```

## **Visual Design Specifications:**

### **Character Representation:**
- **Circle diameter**: 80px
- **Profile picture**: Cropped to circle, 70px diameter
- **Border**: 5px, color matches character theme
- **Hover effect**: Subtle glow and scale up 10%

### **Relationship Lines:**
- **Strong**: 4px line width
- **Medium**: 2px line width
