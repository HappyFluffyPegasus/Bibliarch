# 3D Character Creator - Project Information

## What User Has Confirmed:

### Project Description:
- Making a 3D character creator
- Assets made in Blender
- Everything is named uniformly

### Model Structure:
- Has a base body
- Has changeable assets
- All assets follow 1 armature for posing
- All assets follow 1 armature for scaling height/head size

### Export:
- Exported as GLB format
- Filename: `Neighbor Base V12.glb`
- File size: 1.96 MB
- Contains: everything (base body + all changeable assets)
- Does NOT contain: animations
- Planning to get animations from Mixamo later

### Requirements:
- Must be entirely coded by AI
- NO game engines (Unity/Unreal/Godot) - custom code only
- Platform: Standalone desktop app (final goal)
  - Can develop as web-based first, then package for desktop
- Art style: Low poly
- Scope: Support creation of up to 20 characters

### Current Phase:
- ONLY building the character creator
- NO game modes yet
- NO AI integration yet
- Focus: Asset swapping + armature controls + save/load

### Future Integration:
- Part of larger game: "The Sims meets Gacha Life meets Character.AI"
- Integrates with existing StoryCanvas notes system (Next.js + Supabase)
- Will eventually connect to custom-built game engine (all AI-coded)
