# Bibliarch MVP - Vision Document

## Core Concept

Bibliarch is a **social simulator game** combining:
- **The Sims** - Life simulation and sandbox building
- **Gacha Life** - Character creation and scene making
- **Character.AI** - AI-powered character interactions

**Tagline**: A game where people make their own movies and watch their characters come to life.

## Core Philosophy

### AI Should Assist, Not Dictate

> "AI should be telling you what to do, you should be telling AI what to do."

The AI in Bibliarch will:
- **NEVER** give users direct story advice or tell them what to do
- **NEVER** dictate plot points or character decisions
- Only provide **vague guidance** that helps users recall their own ideas
- Help users **summarize** their conversations into usable notes
- Act out scenes based on **user-defined** character personalities

**Example of GOOD AI behavior:**
> "Hmm, if you're working on the magic system, maybe you should look at the building block you already have about stars and how it's inspired by X and Y. Recalling that information might help you come up with your own ideas."

**Example of BAD AI behavior:**
> "You should make the magic system based on constellations and have the main character discover their powers during an eclipse."

## Three Gameplay Modes

### 1. Life Mode
- Like The Sims or other life simulators
- Characters live in houses and exist day-to-day
- Casual, relaxed gameplay
- No specific narrative requirements
- This will not exist until MUCH later in development

### 2. Story Mode (Manual)
- Player creates a timeline of events
- Player manually creates scenes for those events
- Full control over what happens
- For players with pre-existing characters or specific visions

### 3. AI Story Mode
- Takes from timeline and scenes in Story Mode
- AI generates new scenes (major or minor)
- Player can have AI fill in gaps between timeline nodes
- Example: If you have "goes to Canada" but don't specify what they do there, AI can simulate based on other training or notes

## Key Features

### Character System
- **Free-form text boxes** instead of personality presets
- Prompts for big things (backstory, outlook on life) and small things (favorite food, color)
- All sections are **optional** - not all characters are fully developed
- **No word limits** or, at least, very large limits - describe in great detail
- Characters can **evolve** throughout the story via timeline states

### Relationship System
- **Complex relationships** with depth, one-sidedness, nuance
- Relationship chart with same free-form text approach
- Not limited to simple labels like "friend" or "enemy"
- AI understands and respects relationship dynamics

### Timeline System
- Control **where you are in the storyline**
- See characters at different development stages
- Never lose old versions - like rewatching a show
- Record character states, relationship states at each point
- Multiple parallel tracks for simultaneous events

### Scene System
- 3D camera you can move around
- Subtitles that pop up on screen
- Possibly AI voice acting (future consideration)
- Sound effects, background music
- Characters can be positioned and moved
- Link scenes to timeline events (bidirectional)

### World Building / Sandbox
- **Full open-world map** (exterior is continuous) (for the MVP we are starting off small)
- Building interiors are separate 3D spaces
- Terraforming capabilities
- Place preset buildings, decorations, paths
- Different story worlds separated
- Characters from different origin worlds stay separated

### Memory System
- AI remembers details about characters
- Past references brought up later in story
- Physical traits recognized (if character is short, others might mention it)
- Connection between physical world and characterization

### Master Document System
- Upload existing story documents (.md, .txt, .docx)
- Export from Bibliarch website can be imported
- Multiple master docs per project
- AI uses these for context/prompting
- Always takes newest information as fact

## What Makes This Different

### Problems with Existing Games

**The Sims, Miitopia, Tomodachi Life:**
- No complex relationship mechanics
- No one-sidedness, depth, or nuance in relationships
- Full control removes unpredictability and suspense
- Characters follow actions without internal drive
- Extremely boring gameplay without meaning

### Bibliarch's Solution
- AI provides unpredictability while respecting characterization
- Characters have **motive and reason** behind actions
- Focus on **how characters think** and **why they make decisions**
- Complex mechanics keep players engaged (like Genshin Impact)

## Design Principles

### No Money System
- No in-game currency
- No pay-to-unlock features
- Game is strictly for storytelling
- Avoids the "draining work environment" feeling
- Players escape reality, not recreate its frustrations

### UI/UX Standards
- **Gacha-style** bottom tab navigation
- **Blue color scheme** (matching Bibliarch website)
- **Strategic, intuitive placement**
- Nothing overlapping or confusing
- Quality on par with current Bibliarch website
- Desktop-focused (mobile not required for MVP)

### Separation by Story
- Characters from different origin worlds in different neighborhoods
- Maintains world-building integrity for each story
- Allows multiple character sets at once

---

## Target Audience

### Primary
- **Authors and writers** who want to visualize their stories
- **OC (Original Character) creators**
- **Teenage Girls** (original intended demographic)

### Secondary
- Casual players who enjoy life simulators
- Creative players who want sandbox building
- Consumers who want to watch AI-generated stories

### Use Cases
- Visualizing novel characters
- Planning story arcs and timelines
- Creating fan content with OCs
- "Love Island" style games with friends and/or characters
- D&D campaign visualization
- General creative expression

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- AI voice acting for dialogue
- Real-time collaboration on note-taking
- Shared story/character uploads (like Sims families)
- Custom template creation for specific needs (D&D, themed characters)
- More detailed interior decoration
- Advanced camera AI for cinematic shots
- One time sale
- Life Simulation
